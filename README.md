# techtimeline
Activity for high school intro computer science course

Students try to place when different innovations happened

Students would first work with a paper timeline and timeline cards to starting thinking about when each innovation happened

The menus have a quick description, but the PDF has the full description of each innovation

Current gameplay:

• starts at 1000pts

• once an innovation has been given a decade, a timer starts

• a point is lost every two seconds

• an innovation can be moved or removed by selecting it in another or the same menu

• the check button awards 100 points for new correct answers, but always loses 50 points,
   so students should try to make several guesses before checking

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
• show a subscore for each decade ("1 of 3 correct")

• haven't implemented a win yet - timer should stop (DONE: 2/9/20)
